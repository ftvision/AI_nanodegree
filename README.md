# Udacity AI Nanodegree Notes

This set of notes is from the Udacity AI NanoDegree. It has the following sections

## Notes

I have separated the whole course into 5 sections (not exactly four )

- [Section 1](./Notes_Section1.md)
- [Section 2](./Notes_Section2.md)
- [Section 3](./Notes_Section3.md)
- [Section 4](./Notes_Section4.md)
- [Section 5](./Notes_Section5.md)
- [Programming Notes]((./Notes_Programming.md))

## Labs

- [pac-man lab](./labs/pac-man/README.md): use A* search to guide pac-man to find the fastest way to eat all the food
- [simulated annealing lab](./labs/simulated_annealing/README.md): implement simulated annealing algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem
- [constraint satisfaction lab](./labs/constraint_satisfaction/README.md): use constraint satisfaction algorithms to solve the n-queen problem

## Projects

- [Sudoku Project](./finished_project/Sudoku/README.md): use Constraint Satisfaction algorithms to solve the Sudoku problems
- [Isolation Game](): use Adversarial search to create a computer agent to play the isolation game
- [Air Cargo Logistic Planning](): use search with (domain specific or general) heuristics to solve to air cargo logistic planning problem
- [American Sign Language Recognition](): use Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to recognize American Sign Language (ASL)
